# Environment setup

To learn any language first we have to setup the environment for which we need an IDE(Integrated development environment) and a compiler.

## IDE

IDE stands for integrated devlopment environment which is an application that provide an interface to the devlopers to create a program in any programming language. For example VScode, intellij, Atom etc.

## Compiler

Once your code is ready and you want that the computer to understand the program and to achieve this you need to install a compiler that will translate the program into machine level code that computer understood. For C++ you can install gcc.
