# Datatypes in C++

In mathematics you have learned different type of numbers like integer(1, 99, 999), decimal(3.14, 0.1) and to differentiate and define these numbers in programming languages we have concept of Datatypes. Not only for numbers we have datatypes for different kind of data such as boolean data(true, false), character of words("Sunday") etc. Now we will see all the kind of datatype and there property.

In C++ we classify dattypes into three categories.

- Primary
- Derived
- User defined

## Primary datatypes

Every language has predefined datatype that comes with the language libraries. The user can call and use them directly.
