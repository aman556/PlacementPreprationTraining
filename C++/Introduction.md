# What is programming language?

Language is a vocabulary that helps a person to pass our message to other person. In daily life we communicate with others in languages like Hindi, English, punjabi etc. Just like this we communicate with the computing devices. Some popular languages are C++, Java, python, JS, Golang etc.

## Usecase

All the applications we use daily like instagram, youtube, facebook, google etc are created with the help of programming languages.

## Different kind of applications

- Web application
- Android application
- IOS application

## Web application

These kind of applications are not hosted or we can say running in your mobile phone, laptop, or desktop. They are running on a remote server(some computer at another location that can be access by others). To access these web applications we use different web browsers like google chrome(Own by Google), Bings(by Microdoft), Safari(by Apple).

A web application basically consists of three different layers.
    - Frontend layer
    - Backend layer
    - Database layer

Note :- Each layer can be implemented in many languages and companies have implemented there application in one of the suitable language so they have that language specific openings. So if we want a career in IT sector then we can explore these different layers and that sounds interesting we can search the most demanded languages that implement this layer and then learn and create that language.

### Frontend Layer

This layer is bascially what user is seeing or interacting with while using the application. Everything on the interface you are see like buttons, images, text everthing are presented in an app with the help of Frontend programming languages.

#### Languages and libraries for Frontend

- HTML, CSS, Javascript are languages for front end that are used to create a frontend web application. It is not compulary to learn all language then only we can create a web app but just using HTML, CSS we can create an app but Java script have features that will make the app better.

- React, Angular, Vue are some java script libraries which are in high demand in career opportunity in front end devloper roles.
