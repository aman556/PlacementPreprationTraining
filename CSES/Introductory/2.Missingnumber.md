# Missing Number

## Problem

In this problem there are number from 1 to N but in the given number one number is misssing that we have to find.

There can be multiple approaches here we will discuss two approach one with more time complexity and other with less time complexity.

## Approach 0

- Create an array of size n-1 and store all the elements in the array.
- store the array
- Run a for loop over the array and compare the current element with i+1.
- if the current element is not equal to i + 1 then we will print the element and break the loop.

Time complexity will be O(N) and space complexity will be O(N+1).

## Approach 1

- Now we will solve the problem with less time complexity.
- We know the mathematic formuale to find the sum of N number i.e
        sum of N numbers = (N * (N+1))/2
- So now we will find the sum of N numbers and the sum of all the given numbers.
- As one element is missing then the difference between the sum of n numbers and sum of given numbers will be the answer.

## GENZ Tip

The range of N is 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 so the some of 1 to 2*10^5 can store in long long datatype.
