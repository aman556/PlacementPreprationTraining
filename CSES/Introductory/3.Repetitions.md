# Repetation

## Problem

In this problem we have a string consist of A, C, G, and T charaters. We have to find the max no. of repetation of any word.

## Approach

- In this problem, we will create two variable one to store the current count of repetitive element and other will store the max count.
- then we will run a for loop over the string from 1 index till last index of the string and comapre in if block that current character is equal to the previous one or not if yes then we increase count variable else we will update maxCount variable if current count variable is greater then maxCount.
