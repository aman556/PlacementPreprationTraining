# Weird Algorithm

## Problem

- The problem statement is that a number N in given.
- Range is 1 <= N <= 10^6
- If the number is even divide by 2
- If the number is Odd multiply by 3 and add 1
- Print the all the numbers till the N become 1.

## Approach

- take the input N
- Run a while loop untill the N become 1
- Inside the loop add a if else block
- if the number is even n = n/2
- else n = n*3 + 1

## GENZ Tip

The given range of N is in the range of an integer. But if you see if the number is odd we are multiplying it by 3 and when we get the n odd continously there might come a point where it will go beyond the range limit of integer. So the thing one should keep in mind is that the datype while creating n should be long.

Example:-
For n 704511
At one point the n will become 2635518706 which is out of the range limit of an integer which is -2147483648 to 2147483647.
